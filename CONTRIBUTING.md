## üîß Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - for new features (e.g., `feature/add-python-tutorial`)
- `fix/` - for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/navigation-bug`)
- `docs/` - for documentation (e.g., `docs/improve-contributing-guide`)
- `style/` - for styling changes (e.g., `style/update-button-colors`)
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/simplify-api-calls`)

### Write Quality Code

Follow these guidelines while coding:

- **Keep it simple** - Write clear, readable code
- **Comment when necessary** - Explain complex logic
- **Test your changes** - Ensure everything works as expected
- **Follow existing patterns** - Maintain consistency with the codebase
- **Make atomic commits** - Each commit should represent a single logical change

### Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `Add:` - for new features
- `Fix:` - for bug fixes
- `Update:` - for updates to existing features
- `Remove:` - for removing features or files
- `Refactor:` - for code refactoring
- `Docs:` - for documentation changes
- `Style:` - for formatting changes

**Example:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add: Python tutorial for data structures"
git commit -m "Fix: Navigation menu not displaying on mobile"
git commit -m "Docs: Update installation instructions"
```

## üì§ Submitting Changes

### Sync with Upstream

git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes into your branch
git merge upstream/main
```

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Create a Pull Request

1. **Navigate to your fork** on GitHub
2. **Click "Compare & pull request"**
