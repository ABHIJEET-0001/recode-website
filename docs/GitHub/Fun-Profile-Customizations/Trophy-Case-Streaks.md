# Trophy Case and Contribution Streaks

These tools complement the core GitHub Readme Stats by focusing on **gamification** and **consistency**, turning your contributions into visible achievements.

### GitHub Trophy Case 🏆

This service awards different virtual "trophies" based on your activity, such as total star count, number of commits, number of followers, and maintaining contribution streaks. It’s an excellent motivator for long-term engagement.

**Setup Example:**
To include the trophy case, simply embed the SVG image link in your Readme, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME`:

### GitHub Streaks 🔥
This card displays your current streak of contributions and your longest historical streak, promoting a daily habit of coding. Seeing your streak number grow can be a powerful psychological push!

**Setup Example:**

```markdown
[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=YOUR_USERNAME&theme=highcontrast&date_format=j+M+Y)](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
```

💡 Tip: To maintain a streak, remember that contributions count if they are made within a 24-hour period, based on UTC time.
