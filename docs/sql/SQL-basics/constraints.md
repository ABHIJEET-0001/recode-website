## üìô Welcome to SQL Constraints!

Hey there, new SQL learner! Imagine organizing a big toy box and making sure no toy gets lost or mixed up. Constraints are like special rules you set for your database tables to keep everything in order. They help stop mistakes, like adding a negative age or leaving a name blank. We‚Äôll use a `students` table (with columns like `id`, `name`, and `age`) to show you how it works, step by step!

### üìò What Are Constraints?

Constraints are like guardrails for your data. They are rules you add to columns in a table to:
- Prevent invalid data (e.g., no negative ages like -5).
- Make sure some data is unique (e.g., no two students with the same ID).
- Keep everything consistent across your database.

There are several types of constraints, like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT. Let‚Äôs explore each type with simple examples!

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Add constraints when creating tables to catch mistakes early‚Äîlike setting the rules before the game begins!

### üìò NOT NULL Constraint (No Empty Spots!)

This rule makes sure a column always has a value‚Äîit can‚Äôt be empty (NULL). It‚Äôs perfect for things like names or IDs that you always need.

**How It Works**: If you mark a column as NOT NULL, you must fill it in when adding a new row. If you don‚Äôt, SQL will say, ‚ÄúOops, you forgot something!‚Äù

**Example**:
    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
```sql title="Creating Table with NOT NULL"
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Name must have a value
    age INT
);
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20); -- This works!
-- This will fail: INSERT INTO students (id, age) VALUES (2, 21); -- No name!
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
| id | name  | age |
|----|-------|-----|
| 1  | Alice | 20  |
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

> **What NOT to Do**: Always use NOT NULL for critical fields like names or IDs‚Äîleaving them blank can mess up your records and make it data harder to track.

### üîÑ UNIQUE Constraint (No Doubles Allowed!)

This rule ensures that every value in a column is different‚Äîno duplicates. It‚Äôs great for things like email addresses or student IDs.

**How It Works**: If you try to add the same value twice (e.g., two students with the same email), SQL will stop you and say, ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs already taken!‚Äù

**Example**:
    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
```sql title="Creating Table with UNIQUE"
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE -- No two students can have the same email
);
INSERT INTO students (id, email) VALUES (1, 'alice@example.com'); -- Works!
-- This will fail: INSERT INTO students (id, email) VALUES (2, 'alice@example.com'); -- Duplicate!
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
| id | email              |
|----|--------------------|
| 1  | alice@example.com  |
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

> **What NOT to Do**: Avoid using UNIQUE on columns that might repeat naturally, like ages (e.g., two 20-year-olds)‚Äîit‚Äôll block valid data and cause errors!

### üìò CHECK Constraint (Set Your Own Rules!)

This lets you create a custom rule for a column, like saying ‚Äúage must be 18 or older.‚Äù It‚Äôs like setting a limit on what‚Äôs allowed.

**How It Works**: You write a condition, and SQL checks it every time you add or change data. If the data doesn‚Äôt match, it won‚Äôt let you save it.

**Example**:
    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
```sql title="Creating Table with CHECK"
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18) -- Only ages 18 or higher are allowed
);
INSERT INTO students (id, age) VALUES (1, 20); -- Works!
-- This will fail: INSERT INTO students (id, age) VALUES (2, 16); -- Too young!
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
| id | age |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 20  |
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

> **What NOT to Do**: Avoid overly strict CHECK rules too (e.g., age > 100)‚Äîyou might block valid data and frustrate yourself!

### üîÑ DEFAULT Constraint (Auto-Fill Magic!)

This sets a default value for a column if you don‚Äôt provide one. It‚Äôs handy for things like setting a default city.

**How It Works**: If you leave a column blank, SQL fills it with the default value you chose, saving you time.

**Example**:
    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
```sql title="Creating Table with DEFAULT"
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    city VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Unknown' -- If no city is given, it‚Äôs 'Unknown'
);
INSERT INTO students (id) VALUES (1); -- No city provided, uses default
INSERT INTO students (id, city) VALUES (2, 'Delhi'); -- Overrides default
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
| id | city    |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Unknown |
| 2  | Delhi   |
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

> **What NOT to Do**: Avoid setting a silly default (e.g., age = 0)‚Äîit could lead to confusing or wrong data later!

## ‚úÖ What You‚Äôve Learned

Wow, you‚Äôre doing great! You‚Äôve learned:
- **NOT NULL**: Keeps columns from being empty.
- **UNIQUE**: Stops duplicates.
- **CHECK**: Sets custom limits.
- **DEFAULT**: Adds automatic values.

Try adding these constraints to your own tables and play around with them. Watch out for the "What NOT to Do" tips to keep your database happy and error-free!
